				<h2>Archery at the 2016 Summer Olympics</h2>

				<div class="row">
					<p class="col-sm-10">
						The archery events at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro were held over a seven-day period from 6 to 12 August. Four events took place, all were staged at the Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí. Each National Olympic Committee (NOC) was permitted to enter a maximum of six competitors, three per gender. NOCs that qualified teams for a particular gender were able to send a three-member team to the team event and also have each member compete in the individual event. There were 12 team spots for each gender, thus qualifying 36 individuals through team qualification. All other NOCs might earn a maximum of one quota place per gender for the individual events.

				<h2>Athletics qualification for Rio 2016</h2>

				<div class="row">
					<p class="col-sm-10">
						The Olympic qualification criteria were simplified by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) from a two-tiered "A" and "B" standard approach to a single qualification standard. Each National Olympic Committee was entitled to send up to three athletes per event that had reached that standard in the period from 2015 to 11 July 2016. Nations without a qualified athlete could enter one male and one female athlete who had not achieved the standard. Marathon runners had additional ways to qualify in that top 20 World Championship or top 10 IAAF Gold Label race finishers were treated as having achieved the standard.

				<h2>Basketball strategy</h2>
				<img src="5..jpg" alt="Basketball sport" />
				<div class="row">
					<p class="col-sm-10">
						There are two main defensive strategies: zone defense and man-to-man defense. In a zone defense, each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court. Zone defenses often allow the defense to double team the ball, a manoeuver known as a trap. In a man-to-man defense, each defensive player guards a specific opponent. Offensive plays are more varied, normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball. A quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is known as a cut. A legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate, by standing in the defender's way such that the teammate cuts next to him, is a screen or pick. The two plays are combined in the pick and roll, in which a player sets a pick and then "rolls" away from the pick towards the basket. Screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays; these allow the quick passes and teamwork, which can lead to a successful basket. Teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable. On court, the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which play will occur.

				<h2>Beach Volleyball - how to get in shape?</h2>

				<div class="row">
					<p class="col-sm-10">
						Prepare for the sand. You may think you have a good foundation of fitness already, but sand changes everything. Because sand is so unstable, it saps more of your body's energy when you move. So you can't afford to waste additional energy with inefficient movement patterns. It's critical that you move efficiently, especially through your hips, torso, and shoulders, also known as your “pillar.” This will allow you to conserve energy throughout the match. Exercises like the Plank with Arm Lift and Glute Bridge Marching will help solidify this area and prepare your torso for the intense rotational demands of volleyball, for instance, when you go to swing or dig a hard-driven ball.
